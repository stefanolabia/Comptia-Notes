# Secure Communication Protocols

| Protocol                                               | Description                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**         | Used for secure web browsing, it combines HTTP with SSL/TLS.                                          |
| **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)** | Protocols for securing data transmission in various applications, including HTTPS,FTPS,and more. |
| **SSH (Secure SHell)**                                 | For secure remote shell access and file transfers (e.g., SFTP, SCP).                                  |
| **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**                 | Secures Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet.        |
| **VPN Protocols**                                      | - **PPTP**: Older and less secure.<br>- **L2TP/IPsec**: Combines L2TP and IPsec for more secure VPN connections.<br>- **OpenVPN**: Open-source VPN protocol that uses SSL/TLS for key exchange.<br>- **WireGuard**: Modern VPN protocol designed for simplicity and efficiency. |
| **PGP/GPG (Pretty Good Privacy/GNU Privacy Guard)**    | Encrypts emails and files using both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.                             |
| **FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure)**               | FTP combined with SSL/TLS.                                                                            |
| **SMTPS, IMAPS, & POP3S**                              | Secure versions of standard mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) using SSL/TLS.                          |
| **S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)** | Standard for public key encryption and signing of email.                                           |
| **DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)**           | Provides security for datagram protocols like UDP.                                                    |
| **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)**                    | Security protocol for Wi-Fi networks, succeeding WPA2.                                                |
| **QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)**              | A transport layer protocol developed by Google that uses multiple encryption layers.                  |
| **EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security)** | Used in wireless networks and point-to-point connections to provide mutual authentication.           |
